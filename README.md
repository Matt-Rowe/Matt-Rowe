## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt. I am brand new to this field and it most definitely will not be easy for me. I look forward to not only learning from Dr. Miller, but my fellow classmates as well. I know for a fact I am going to make A LOT of mistakes.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning the ins and outs of Github
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about just about anything. I am always open to learning something new or talking about stuff I already know.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: matthew.rowe@student.northampton.edu (I check my school email multiple times per day)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy gaming, listening to music, golfing, LEGOs, and I love watching football. Go birds!
